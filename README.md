This repository demonstrates the use of SQL Views 
->A view is a virtual table based on a SQL query.
->It does not store data physically
->Views are an essential feature in relational databases that
  provide abstraction, security, consistency,Resuability and simplicity.  
->They are especially useful when working with sensitive information, 
  complex joins, or reusable queries.

purpose:
 1. Security – Restrict access to sensitive columns by exposing only selected fields through views.  
 2. Consistency – Provide a standardized query interface for different users and reports.  
 3. Data Abstraction – Simplify complex join queries into a single virtual table for ease of use.  
 4. Reusability – Store frequently used queries as views to avoid redundancy.
